To build OpenAL-soft as a static linked library on Windows:

		Follow the instructions (go into build/ and use cmake .. to generate build files),
		Look inside build/ for config.h , and find : 

				#define AL_API  __declspec(dllexport)
				#define ALC_API __declspec(dllexport)

		Change these to :

				#define AL_API  //__declspec(dllexport)
				#define ALC_API //__declspec(dllexport)

		Open the project up in VS, and set the OpenAL32 project (not : not the ALL_BUILD, the OpenAL32 project) properties (Under general) : 
		    Change : Configuration Type -> Static library
		    Change : Target Extension -> lib

		Build the OpenAL project again, and the output folder should now contain the static OpenAL32.lib


To build OpenAL-soft as dynamic, just follow the first instruction, using cmake .. and open up and build the dll.
